# Surfs_Up
## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to explore SQLAlchemy and Flask. The deliverables for the challenge were summary statistics for the months of June and December. These were pulled using the extract package from SQLAlchemy, and converted into a pandas dataframe. 

## Results 
The results from this project were in the form of tables. The first table to examine will be the descriptive statistics for June.
