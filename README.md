# Surfs_Up
## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to explore SQLAlchemy and Flask. The deliverables for the challenge were summary statistics for the months of June and December. These were pulled using the extract package from SQLAlchemy, and converted into a pandas dataframe. 

## Results 
The results from this project were in the form of tables. The first table to examine will be the descriptive statistics for June.

As you can see from the table above, the lowest temperature recorded in June is 64 degrees, and the maximum is 85. There is a standard deviation of about 3.25 degrees, and the average temperature for this month in Hawaii is approximately 75 degrees - perfect weather for surfing and ice cream! 

The next table is for December's summary statistics.

The table above shows that the lowest temperature recorded in Hawaii in December is 56 degrees, while the hottest is 85 degrees! The average temperature for the month of December is 71 degrees, much warmer than other parts of the United States this time of year! December sees a slightly larger standard deviation of roughly 3.75 degrees. 

## Conclusion
The project was a solid preface into planning for a Surf and Shake Shop in Hawaii. Preliminary data shows that the weather in December is substantially warmer than other parts of the contintential United States, making it a sought after destination for tourists year round. One thing to research further would be water temperatures year-round. If the water is significantly colder in December, it may be to the business' advantage to rent out wetsuits as well. Another thing to consider would be sunlight throughout the year, figuring out the time in which the shop will stay open longest.
